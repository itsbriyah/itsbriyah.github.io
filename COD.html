		<h4> Review from: @spyder_bby </h4>
			<p> This game is a waste of money imo, the sbmm absolutely sucks and I'm constantly recieving shadow bans! Eveyrtime I try the ranked play mode I am met with "dev errors" and server disconnections causing me to lose SR in game, i've tried everything from contacting support, updating my drivers, scanning and repairing my files to even uninstalling and redownloading the game and nothing works. They need to work on fixing this gamw  instead of creating more bundle packs for people to buy! </p>

		<h4> Review from: @dasfuzzy </h4>
			<p> Honestly I had high expections for this remastering but yet again I am let down. Multiplayer is fun and lively as it once was but I just wished they would nerf the shotguns and remove riot shields. The only plus from this game is that they brought back Rebirth Island so if you enjoy Warzone like I do then you'd apprieciate that.

		<h4> Review from: @limeycakes09152 </h4>
			<p> I recently just built a pc and one of my friends recommended this game to me! It's extremely competitive but its sooooo addicting. I have so much fun on here, especially when you find cool people to play with. The graphics are realistic and mechanics are very smooth. There are tons of different modes to try so you'll never get bored of doing the same things over and over! Overrall I give this game a 8.4/10 </p>
